•	Submit button – After the user types in the time of day, there’s a submit button that they need to press in order to see the suggested meal for that time.
•	Display Suggestion – The user’s meal suggestion suggested by the app will appear on the display suggestion where the user will see what type of food they should have at that time of day.
